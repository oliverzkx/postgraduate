\begin{abstract}
This report presents a detailed study on fast mesh-to-mesh remapping algorithms based on hash structures. The remapping process is crucial in computational physics simulations, where data must be transferred between different spatial discretizations efficiently and accurately.

We investigate several variants of hash-based methods, including hierarchical hash tables and memory-optimized strategies, as alternatives to traditional kD-tree-based approaches. The proposed techniques significantly reduce memory operations and enable rapid remapping for large-scale meshes.

Experimental evaluations on 2-D mesh data demonstrate that the hash-based methods achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup over classical techniques, with competitive accuracy. We further analyze their performance across serial CPU, multi-core CPU (OpenMP), and GPU (OpenCL) implementations, confirming their scalability and suitability for high-performance computing environments.
